# This directory contains database and file backups
# 
# Backup files are created automatically by backup.sh script
# and can be restored using restore.sh script
#
# File naming convention:
# - attendance_system_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.db (database backup)
# - uploads_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.tar.gz (student photos backup)
# - exports_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.tar.gz (reports backup)
# - full_backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.tar.gz (complete backup)
#
# Backups older than 30 days are automatically cleaned up
